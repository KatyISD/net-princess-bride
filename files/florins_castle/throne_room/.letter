To: Vizzini, Sicilian Strategist
From: Prince Humperdinck of Florin
Subject: Operation Buttercup

Vizzini,
As discussed, the time has come to proceed with the abduction 
of Princess Buttercup. You are to intercept her during her daily 
ride through the forest and ensure she is taken swiftly and discreetly.
The cover story must be airtight—she is to be found dead on the 
Guilder frontier, with clear signs of Guilder aggression.

You will be accompanied by your associates: the giant Fezzik and 
the swordsman Montoya. I trust you will keep them in line. Do not 
underestimate Buttercup’s resolve; she may resist, but she must 
not be harmed. Her death must appear tragic, not brutal.

Once the deed is done, return to Florin under cover of night. I 
will handle the political fallout and ensure Guilder bears the 
blame. This incident will serve as the spark for war, and I 
expect no complications.

Failure is inconceivable.

- Prince Humperdinck
